            <p>
                The idea of this web application was inspired by ReRoll, a restaurant near Campus where you can play
                board
                games and role games. It is necessary because it is hard for the users to reserve a table, it serves as
                marketing as well, and as a control tool for the restaurant to help serve faster their customers and
                know
                exactly how many people will be seated in each table and what games will be used.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The application will show to each user his data when login in, for example, his reservation for N number of
            people on Friday that week and that they will play Risk, also he could look the food menu and order from the
            app or just tell his order to the waiter by previously watching the menu on the app.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The main objective is to speed up the arrival of the customers for having more playing time and improving the
            clientâ€™s experience. The medium-term objective is to improve the Food Menu by taking into consideration the
            orders of the clients, discovering the board games that are the most used to have more of them in stock so
            every table could have at least one of them.
